# Smart City Delivery Optimization using AI

This project is a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence solution to optimize delivery routes in a smart city environment, developed as part of the University of Hull‚Äôs 2024/2025 AI coursework.

## Problem Statement
Delivery services in urban environments face challenges like congestion, road conditions, weather, and terrain. The goal is to:
- Predict traversal cost for each city grid cell.
- Find the most efficient path for delivery.
- Train a reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal navigation strategies.

## Project Structure
- `task2CodeForCoursework.ipynb`: Implements and compares Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Neural Network models.
- `Task3CodeForCoursework.ipynb`: Loads the best model (Polynomial Regression) to predict traversal costs for a city grid and applies preprocessing pipelines.
- `Task4CodeForCoursework.ipynb`: Implements Q-learning for a self-driving taxi in a 5x5 grid.

## üèó How to Run
This Information is also included in the readme file 'in the file' named <AiRouteDevelopment> on Github

###  Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
