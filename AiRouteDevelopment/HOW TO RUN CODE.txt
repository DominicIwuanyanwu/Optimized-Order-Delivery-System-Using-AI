The code for each assessment from task 2 to task 4 are named respectively and can be found in the zip file

task2CodeForCoursework 

Task3CodeForCoursework

Task4CodeForCoursework

Noteably, for task 2 and 3 where the grid is being loaded you may need to change the file location to your systems pathway 

That is , for task 2 where the traversal data cost is being loaded 
Kindly change the pathway to the pathway of where you extracted all the data
same for task 3 

In task 3 the polynomial regression data from task 2 is also being used(loaded). You may need to change this as well to your pathway
 

The traversal_Cost_data and provided_grid are in the zip file.

Thank you very much.
And Happy New Year!!!
